To run a complete test and evaluation, once the data has been setup, run main.sh 
from inside the code/ directory.  The only argument is the number of epochs to 
train for before fine tuning.  We recommend 40, but this will take a while.
We recommend running inside a tmux environment.  The output will be an accuracy 
and F1 score.

1.  cd code
2.  tmux new -t <session name>
2.  bash main.sh <num_epochs>
