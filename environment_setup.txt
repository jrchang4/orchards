Directory Setup and Dataloader.py: Our cloud bucket has a number of directories. The expanded dataset is included within "combined". 
Within combined there will be "train", "val" and "test" directories. These were created using the Python Package split-folders. 
In dataloader.py, you can change the path that the train and val generators use in the 'else' statement if you'd like to chnage the dataset 
that the val or train set points to. For example, to test on the holdout technoserve data.
