1. Use Python 3.7

2.  Install gcsfuse if not already installed

3.  Data must be mounted through a GCP bucket as follows.  
Run the command outside the project directory, not the /code directory.

  gcloud auth application-default login

  gcsfuse --implicit-dirs es262-orchards-forests data
  
4. Our cloud bucket has a number of directories. The expanded dataset is included within "combined". Within combined there will be "train", "val" and "test" directories. These were created using the Python Package split-folders. In dataloader.py, you can change the path that the train and val generators use in the 'else' statement if you'd like to chnage the dataset that the val or train set points to. For example, to test on the holdout technoserve data.
